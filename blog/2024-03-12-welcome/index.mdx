`IaCDOG` is `IaC` static code visualization service. Allowing anyone using `Terraform` can get readable cloud infrastructure diagram fast and easy.

Currently, `IaCDOG` only supports Terraform visualizations, but we will continue to expand it to support many other `IaC` visualizations.

**Compared to other IaC visualization services, IaCDOG is:**

1. Provides diagrams based on **cloud resources**, making it easy to understand the infrastructure structure.
2. Scan `tf` files without visualizing `tfplan` files to enable quick visualization without separate API communication.
3. Provides **code-based visualization** rather than drag-and-drop visualization, which is convenient to apply in practice.
